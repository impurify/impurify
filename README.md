* **Deprecated key** (used to sign commits that need current Github compatibility, just like this repository’s use of SHA1 commit hashes):\

* **WWW:**  *Not yet.*  I obviously have a great domain for that—and from my recent need to find a memorable Github username, I serendipitously discovered that `impurify.com` and `impurify.me` were available.  I will probably have some various websites.
* ~~Does not use Microsoft Github.~~  *So much for my moral purity.*
