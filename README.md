*On [**Wednesday, January 15, 2025**](https://www.supremecourt.gov/search.aspx?filename=/docket/docketfiles/html/public/23-1122.html), please [remember 1997](https://web.archive.org/web/19971114041230/http://www.eff.org/pub/Legal/Cases/ACLU_v_Reno/19970626_eff_cda.announce).*

I `=` **impurify**, a.k.a. **[have@anonymous.sex](mailto:have@anonymous.sex)**.

Get in touch:

* **Preferred key** (post-quantum encryption subkey; [GnuPG @^2.5.1](https://lists.gnupg.org/pipermail/gnupg-announce/2024q3/000485.html)):\
[`01A6D 81EEA D7EEE C393D EC140 1F489 4C154 E1B8E E32E9 059CA`](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/impurify/impurify/master/pgp/have-post-quantum-anonymous-sex.asc)
* **Deprecated key** (used to sign commits that need current Github compatibility, just like this repository’s use of SHA1 commit hashes):\
[`02AD AF4C 9F1D C35C 8FF1  28D8 0D6F 41CD 0B6A A57F`](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/impurify/impurify/master/pgp/have-anonymous-sex.asc)
* **WWW:**  *Not yet.*  I obviously have a great domain for that—and from my recent need to find a memorable Github username, I serendipitously discovered that `impurify.com` and `impurify.me` were available.  I will probably have some various websites.
* ~~Does not use Microsoft Github.~~  *So much for my moral purity.*
